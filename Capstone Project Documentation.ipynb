It is what matters most when a startup is looking up to setup a new office location or restaurateurs or fast food giants like dominos, KFC zooming in for nice spot or an ice cream shop like corner house in busy junction.\nIn this project, we will try to build a feature for recommendation engine which might be used by realtor for their web portal and also mobile platform to send personalized recommendations to its subscribers. It could be self trained bot / personal assist with realtor features which specializes in showing personalized recommendations based on individuals preferences as everyone\u2019s requirements are not the same. Let\u2019s illustrate with an use case.\nUse Case:- A student has got an admission in foreign unitversity (CMU, Pittsburg) and now in search of accomodation. He / She will do lot of research and talk to their friends / families for opinion of best neighborhoods in the state. They stumble upon advisor app which understands user preferences and suggests best place to live in. While we could debate which colleges within the are the 'best,' that's not the goal of this case. Instead, ride along with us as we determine which neighborhood in Pennsylvania are the best for students who look for everything at one's reach. You know, the type of places where there's energy and stimulation, but the type of place you can walk around at night. The happiest, chillest, most downright fun places where one can think of going to college where you won't break the bank, or worry about their well being. While some of these may not seem like a 'real' college town per se, when you look at the numbers, it's hard to argue against !\nAssumption:- Student already has couple friends / relatives in Allegheny County.\nIs it the booming businesses? The good food? The top-rated schools? The diversity?\n\n**Data**\n\nNow that we have understood the business requirements. It is time to analyze and gather data for it. We will be using Pennsylvania municipalties data for helping our student to find best neighborhood. We have collected data from valid sources, opensocrata for our analysis and performed preliminary analysis for better understanding the data and preparing it for modelling. Once we collected the required data, next step is preparation and understand it better by applying normalization techniques - Getting rid of null values, duplicate rows, data wrangling and formatting the data (Standardization). After the data is standardized the qualified data is ready to be processed. We will query for each of their geo locations using geocoder library and venues from FourSquare API. For few of the locations, foursquare doesn't have data, we shall drop such rows as they are not useful for our analysis.\nBased on the amenities provided by foursquare in the neighbourhood, Then cluster the nearby venues to find out the top ten amenities available for each location and extract those features. Based on the amenities cluster the neighbourhoods which have similar characteristics. As we know user preferences, these clusters can be analyzed and recommended for living !\n\n**Report**\n\n*Methodology:-*\n\nThe methodology I used is pretty simple. As illustrated above, I used K-Means clusttering algorithm to cluster based on the amenities, cluster the neighbourhoods which have similar characteristics. As we know user preferences are taken into consideration such as Banks, Shopping Malls, Bus Station, Grocery, Resturants, Coffee Shops, Deli Foods/ Bakeries etc ... Find out which ones are best for living. Seems to be simple question, definitely can be done in much better ways and options are debatable and that's why we called it BON :)\n\n*Results:-*\n\nBased on the amenities available in each area, the city-county combinations are divided into 4 clusters. Each cluster has a unique amenity. For example Cluster 1 is group of amenities found in any key junction of neighborhood with parks, shopping, grocery, bank Cluster 2 is the group which contains needs for tourist ppl such as restaurants and motels for accomodation Cluster 3 is mostly about food joints and super markets Cluster 4 is the grouping of most happening places consisting of restaurants, nightlife, pubs, malls, banks & entertainment centers\n\n*Discussion:-*\n\nWithout a lot more work in the initial data exploration and methodology phase, it would not be possible to figure out what are top amenities in the neighborhood that helps in making the decision for living in that area !\nThough the data has gone through exploratory analysis, some of the issues can be found during actual run of data. For ex: few locations didn't return geo location and few others didn't return any result for FourSquare API and couldn't find nearby venues. My observation is that the Data Science methodology is a highly iterative process which needs going back and forth to tune the data as needed.\n\n*Conclusion:-*\n\nAfter examination of the clusters we discovered that 'Forest Hills Borough' in Allegheny County is closest match and suitable option for recommendation and will be shown as top priority.\nNote:- Assuming that one of the family lives in Forest hills it would be easier for the student to use their car for college commuting (sometimes) otherwise Bus station is also available. Also Forest hills is affordable and at the same time has numerous part time job vacancies for tutoring to small kids during free time.\n\n4 Forest Hills Borough Deli / Bodega Shopping Plaza Grocery Store Bank Brewery Burger Joint Bus Station Coffee Shop Convenience Store Diner\nIn fact, it is quite likely I will return to this idea and build upon it for nearby recommendations using Alexa with Voice !\n\n**Thanks for reading.**",
